# unit-4-game
Instruction:
Create a gem collecting game where you will have a random number that you must match by clicking the gems with different values.
Each Gem has a random value assigned at the beginning of the game and it is hidden so you do not know the value until you click the gem and it adds on to your score. When your score equals the random number you win and the game resets and you get another random number and the gems are reassigned a new value. If you go over the random number you lose and the game resets again.
